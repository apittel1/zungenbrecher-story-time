1. One day on the ASU campus, Dr. Mehlhase was pacing the floor in her schloss.
2. She was awaiting the Baeckerei to open for business that day.
3. After getting herself a croissant, she decided to get in her Porsche and started driving to Flagstaff.
4. Once she arrived at her destination, she went straight for the Biergarten. 
5. Rammstein was playing and she immediately felt calm.
6. So she decided the best thing to order was some Apfelkuchen. 
7. She dropped it onto her lap -- good thing she was wearing her Lederhose!
8. She cleaned herslef up and went out to the Hauptstrasse. 
9. While heading down the Haupstrasse, she came across a Baeckerei.
10. Once at the door she saw it was gesperrt but noticed a suspicious looking Hund in a nearby alley.
11. Upon following the Hund, she found herself standing in front a dumpster full of Gebaeck. 
12. What she did next even suprised the Hund.
